I had completed Task-3 (Design A Landing Page On Any Genre Using Either Figma Or Adobe XD) through Figma.
I took the topic of "online courses" with the website named "Foundation Class".
In Figma, I took the desktop-sized layout and then I attached the background.
And attached logo's from internet also created some logo's in the app which i have downloaded from play store.
I had used rectangular frameworks for highlighting the options and I gave color to that .
