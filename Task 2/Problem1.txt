Step 1:  Start
Step 2:  Declare Integer numb, divisor, remainder
   
Step 3:   Output "Enter the number: "
Step 4:   Input numb
Step 5:   Assign divisor = 3
Step 6:   While num>=divisor
        Assign num = num-divisor
Step 7:   End
Step 8:   Assign remainder = num
Step 9:   If remainder==0
        Output "The number is divisible by 3"
Step 10:   False:
        Output "The number is not divisible by 3"
Step 11:  Stop
